# deadfish-machine
okay, this is one of my first working drafts in logisim.
It is of the clone of the famous esolang [deadfish](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Deadfish), implemented on hardware with logic gates and stuff.
# commands

The machine opcodes are kinda.. strange:
- i.. `0x09` 
- d.. `0x0b`
- s.. `0x0c`
- o.. `0x30` *(bruh)*
So are the microcode instruction, but meh, will add later when I need more commits
